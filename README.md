# Operating System Simulation [MidOS]- CSCI 480 PE1 (NIU)
**Author:** Jose Barron  
**Z-ID:** Z2013735  

## Project Overview
This project simulates a simplified operating system developed as part of CSCI 480 PE1 at Northern Illinois University. The OS manages process scheduling, memory allocation, heap management, shared memory, and event handling through a set of custom opcodes executed by a virtual CPU. The implementation showcases essential operating system principles including paging, context switching, and synchronization.

## Key Features

### Virtual Machine
- Implements a virtual CPU with general-purpose and special-purpose registers (e.g., IP, PID, SP).
- Executes a custom instruction set with support for arithmetic, stack, and control operations.
- Tracks clock cycles and system flags (zero, sign).
- Supports loading and executing programs independently.

### Memory Management
- Implements a virtual memory system using paged memory.
- Maps virtual addresses to physical addresses using a page table.
- Supports memory isolation and simulates MMU behavior.
- Loads programs into memory non-contiguously.

### Process Management
- Implements PCBs (Process Control Blocks).
- Maintains process state (Ready, Running, Sleeping, Waiting, Terminated).
- Supports preemptive priority-based scheduling and context switching.
- Tracks clock cycles, context switches, and sleep duration.

### Shared memory + Events + Locks
- Adds support for:
  - Shared Memory (`MapSharedMem`)
  - Lock acquisition and release (`AcquireLock`, `ReleaseLock`)
  - Event signaling and waiting (`SignalEvent`, `WaitEvent`)
- Processes waiting on locks or events are properly queued and rescheduled.

### Heap Allocation 
- Adds heap region per process for dynamic memory allocation.
- Implements `Alloc` and `FreeMemory` opcodes to manage heap segments.
- Maintains a heap page table to track allocations and prevent overflows.
- Heap segments include address, size, and usage status.

### Virtual Memory
- Implements a virtual memory system:
  - Virtual-to-physical page mapping.
  - `isValid` and `isDirty` flags per page.
  - Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement.
- Handles page faults and swaps pages to/from simulated disk.
- Tracks page faults, swap-ins, and swap-outs.
- Blocks processes that canâ€™t proceed due to lack of memory and resumes them when possible.

## Additional Features

- **Idle Process**
  - Defined in `idle.txt` with PID 999, runs only when no other process is eligible.
  - Always has the lowest priority, runs in fixed memory location.

- **Shared Memory**
  - 10 fixed shared memory regions (1000 bytes each).
  - Support for `MapSharedMem` to enable inter-process communication.

- **Full Virtual Memory Model**
  - Every process uses virtual addresses exclusively.
  - Page tables created at load time, all memory accesses validated.
  - Page faults suspend the current process if no memory is available.

- **Memory Cleanup**
  - On process exit, all physical pages and heap allocations are freed.
  - Locks held by exiting process are released and waiting processes are rescheduled.

- **Priority Inversion Handling**
  - Lower-priority processes inherit the priority of higher-priority blocked processes temporarily.
  - Reverts after lock is released.

- **Console I/O**
  - `Printr`, `Printm`, `Printcr`, `Printcm` and `Input`, `Inputc` implemented for console I/O.

- **Stack Overflow Prevention**
  - Stack region is isolated and protected from overlapping with heap or code.

- **Instruction Execution & Safety**
  - Robust execution of all opcodes with register validation and fault checks.
  - Illegal memory access results in process termination and full diagnostic printout.

## How to Compile
1. Compile the project using `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o os main.cpp cpu.cpp memory.cpp ProcessScheduler.cpp pcb.cpp program.cpp OperatingSystem.cpp hex.cpp -std=c++17

## How to Run
```bash
./os <memory_size_in_bytes> <program1.txt> <program2.txt> ... <idle.txt>
```
- `./os` is the compiled executable for MidOS.
- The first argument is the **total program memory size** in bytes (e.g., 32768).
- Each `<programN.txt>` is a user program loaded in the order they appear.
- Programs **earlier on the command line are given higher priority**.
- A **maximum of 31 user programs** can be provided.
- **EXAMPLE 1:** 
```bash
./os 1024 test_opcodes.txt legal.txt illegal.txt killer.txt high_waiter.txt lock_holder.txt low_waiter.txt heapfail.txt heap_test.txt sleep1.txt sleep2.txt sleep3.txt test_eventi.txt test_eventi_signal.txt sharedmem1.txt sharedmem2.txt SetPriorityI.txt SetPriority.txt SetPriorityWrong.txt
```
  **Expected Output - output-idle.txt:**
  - The `output.txt` file provides a comprehensive log of OS activities, including memory allocation, process scheduling, heap operations, event signaling, and shared memory mapping. It includes structured output for each process, detailing memory usage, context switches, page faults, heap allocations, and termination statistics.
  - The log includes diagnostic messages for key OS operations such as memory allocation, page faults, shared memory mapping, lock acquisition, event signaling, and process termination.
- **EXAMPLE 2:** 
```bash
./os 512 sleep1.txt sleep2.txt sleep3.txt
```
  **Expected Output - output-idle.txt:**
  - The `output-idle.txt` file highlights OS behavior when the idle process is the primary active process due to other processes being blocked, sleeping, or terminated.
  - It includes key events such as idle process activation, memory allocation/deallocation, and transitions when processes resume or terminate.
  - The log provides a summary of idle cycles, memory state, and the final system halt when only the idle process remains active.
